## About

My resume is build on top on LateX and moderncv. This repo distributes a copy of moderncv in the homonymous folder.
I've modified the "banking" style header to fit my tastes in the `customHead.inc.tex` file.

## Why LateX?

This is very pratical. Editing this resume is very easy and no time is wasted taking care of the layout.

## How to generate the PDF?

Edit the tex file as you wish and simply run `make` after.
